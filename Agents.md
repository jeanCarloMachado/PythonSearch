We love python fire for commands

Never replace a command that is a binnary like entries_editor edit key for its python prefixed version like python -m pythonsearch.entries_editor edit key


We highly prefer to use python fire to otehr ways of interacting with the program in teh cli. Always check if there is a binary to interact with th program already if so use it.
