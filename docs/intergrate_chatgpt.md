# Enable ChatGPT entry geneartion and prompt automation
To enable ChatGPT in python_search, you will need to add your OpenAI API key as an environment variable in your initialization files. To generate an OpenAI API key, go to openai.com and scroll down to "API", log-in, and press "View API-Keys". Generate a new secret key and copy it.

Once you have your API key, add it to your initialization files as "export OPENAI_KEY=[Key here]".

Finally, run python_search register_new_ui and enter a title/enter content and select generate content or desc./Title to verify ChatGPT integration is working.

Once you have verified that ChatGPT is working, you can start using it to generate content for your python_search project.
